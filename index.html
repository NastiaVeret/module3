                <h2>Chicken</h2>
                <p>Chickens come in various breeds, each with unique characteristics. They progress through different life stages, starting as eggs, hatching into chicks, and maturing into pullets (young hens) and cockerels (young roosters). Hens typically
                    begin laying eggs at around 5-6 months old, with egg production influenced by factors like breed and environment. Roosters, the male chickens, play a role in fertilizing eggs and exhibit behaviors like crowing to establish territory.
                    Molting is a natural process where chickens shed and regrow feathers, occurring annually and affecting egg production temporarily..</p>

                <h2>Beef</h2>
                <p>Beef, derived from cattle such as cows and bulls, is a globally consumed meat. It's available in various cuts, each with distinct qualities for flavor and texture. Rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals like iron and zinc, beef also contains
                    saturated fats and cholesterol, requiring moderate consumption. Grading systems classify beef based on marbling, color, and texture, aiding quality assessment. Cooking methods vary from grilling to stewing, depending on the cut and
                    desired doneness. Cattle farming encompasses breeding, feeding, and care, with practices ranging from traditional pastures to modern feedlots.</p>

                <h2>Sushi</h2>
                <p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish known for its vinegared rice served with a variety of ingredients, including seafood, vegetables, and occasionally fruits. Types of sushi include nigiri, maki, sashimi, temaki, and chirashi, each offering
                    a unique combination of flavors and textures. Ingredients in sushi range from raw or cooked seafood like tuna, salmon, and shrimp to vegetables such as cucumber, avocado, and pickled radish. Sushi rice is seasoned with a mixture of
                    rice vinegar, sugar, and salt, giving it a distinctive sweet and tangy taste.</p>
